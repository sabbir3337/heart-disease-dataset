# ❤️ AI-Powered Heart Disease Prediction

An AI-driven system that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health records using machine learning algorithms. This project demonstrates how AI’s power to analyze clinical data and support early diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset

We use the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anshupandey/Machine_Learning_Training/master/heart.csv) which contains 303 records and the following features:

| Feature                     | Description                                 |
